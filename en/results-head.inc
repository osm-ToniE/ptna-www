            <p>
                The column "Latest Changes" links to an HTML page which shows the differences to the last analysis results.
                These are coloured, you can use navigation buttons <img class="diff-navigate" src="/img/diff-navigate.png" alt="Navigation"> at the bottom right or the characters 'j' (forward) and 'k' (backward) to jump from difference to difference.
                This column includes the date of the last analysis where relevant changes have emerged.
                Older dates mean that there were no changes in the results.
                Nevertheless, the data has been analyzed as denoted in the column "Date of Analysis".

                An icon <img src="/img/Test.svg" width=19 height=19 alt="yes" title="Test GTFS to CSV injection" /> in the column "Lines" (last column) indicates that
                GTFS data is available which can be injected into the CSV data (in OSM Wiki).
                The CSV data describes the routes which are expected to be mapped in OSM.
                A click on the icon starts a test injection. You can check the result against your expectations.
